  <!-- About Me -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about transforming raw data into decision-ready insights. With hands-on 
      experience at AWS, IBM, Reigate Builders, and Shopalyst, I bridge the gap between 
      business strategy and data-driven solutions. Currently pursuing my MS in Business 
      Analytics at USC, I focus on analytics, visualization, and applied machine learning 
      to deliver impact.

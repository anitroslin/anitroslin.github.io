      <h1>Anit Roslin Paul</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Data Analytics Professional | MSBA @ USC | Ex-AWS, IBM, Shopalyst</p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about automation, analytics, and data science. My journey has been about transforming raw data into insights that drive real-world impact. 
        From automating CI/CD pipelines at IBM, to building analytics platforms at AWS, to enabling smarter digital commerce at Shopalyst, I’ve consistently sought opportunities 
        to bridge the gap between technology and business value. Currently, at USC, I’m expanding my expertise in machine learning, big data, and AI-driven decision-making, 
        with a focus on applying these skills to solve high-impact problems. I believe in the power of data to tell stories, drive change, and inspire innovation.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about automation, analytics, and data science. My journey has been about transforming raw data into insights that drive real-world impact. 
        From automating CI/CD pipelines at IBM, to building analytics platforms at AWS, to enabling smarter digital commerce at Shopalyst, I’ve consistently sought opportunities 
        to bridge the gap between technology and business value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, at USC, I’m expanding my expertise in machine learning, big data, and AI-driven decision-making, with a focus on applying these skills to solve high-impact problems. 
        I believe in the power of data to tell stories, drive change, and inspire innovation.

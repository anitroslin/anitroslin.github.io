      <h1>Anit Roslin Paul</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Data Analytics Professional | MSBA @ USC | Ex-AWS, IBM, Shopalyst</p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Iâ€™m deeply passionate about automation, analytics, and data science. 
        My journey has been about transforming raw data into insights that drive real-world impact. 
        From automating CI/CD pipelines at IBM, to building analytics platforms at AWS, 
        to enabling smarter digital commerce at Shopalyst, Iâ€™ve consistently sought opportunities 
        to bridge the gap between technology and business value.  
        Currently, at USC, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in machine learning, 
        big data, and AI-driven decision-making, with a focus on applying these skills 
        to solve high-impact problems.  
        I believe in the power of data to tell stories, drive change, and inspire innovation.
